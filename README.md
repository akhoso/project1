# ImagineAnalytics

Project: Providing Microsoft movie insights from current market to help guide them into deciding where to invest. 

Team Members: Alex Benedict, Aneeta Khoso

Data sources were generated from IMDB datasets and Wikipedia.  Multiple datasets were imported into Tableau and manipulated to include some calculated fields.  The calculated and default fields were used to depict various charts to present meaningful highlights to Microsoft.

Data remained in raw form when imported into Tableau. Although it was not 'cleaned' we did not run into dirty data through the project.

The datasets are larger than GitHub would allow us to upload, therefore unavailable on GitHub.

Goals: Showcase a variety of options available to the company for possible investment.

Findings: We have found that documentaries are on the rise and a good option if investors are looking for a quick start  with a lower budget. An alternative option would be to go into theatrical production, which is the mail type of production industry-wide. If they decide to go into theater, the genre they decide to invest into will determine the revenue generated, as some are top grossing versus and others noticably struggling.

Presentation is available at in this repository.
